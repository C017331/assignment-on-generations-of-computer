# assignment-on-generations-of-computer
in this assignment we will learn about the improvements made in comuter .
first we should get little information on the generations of computer:
Generation in computer terminology is a change in technology a computer is/was being used. Initially, the generation term was used to distinguish between varying hardware technologies. Nowadays, generation includes both hardware and software, which together make up an entire computer system.

There are five computer generations known till date.

Computer - First Generation:-
The period of first generation was from 1946-1959. The computers of first generation used vacuum tubes as the basic components for memory and circuitry for CPU (Central Processing Unit). These tubes, like electric bulbs, produced a lot of heat and the installations used to fuse frequently. Therefore, they were very expensive and only large organizations were able to afford it.

In this generation, mainly batch processing operating system was used. Punch cards, paper tape, and magnetic tape was used as input and output devices. The computers in this generation used machine code as the programming language.

The main features of the first generation are −

    Vacuum tube technology
    Unreliable
    Supported machine language only
    Very costly
    Generated a lot of heat
    Slow input and output devices
    Huge size
    Need of AC
    Non-portable
    Consumed a lot of electricity

Some computers of this generation were −

    ENIAC
    EDVAC.
    we sholud also pay ateention to the advancement made henceforth:
    
    Computer - Second Generation:-
    The period of second generation was from 1959-1965. In this generation, transistors were used that were cheaper, consumed less power, more compact in size, more reliable and faster than the first generation machines made of vacuum tubes.
    
    Computer - Third Generation:-
    The period of third generation was from 1965-1971. The computers of third generation used Integrated Circuits (ICs) in place of transistors. A single IC has many transistors, resistors, and capacitors along with the associated circuitry.

The IC was invented by Jack Kilby. This development made computers smaller in size, reliable, and efficient.

    Computer - Fourth Generation:-
    The period of fourth generation was from 1971-1980. Computers of fourth generation used Very Large Scale Integrated (VLSI) circuits. VLSI circuits having about 5000 transistors and other circuit elements with their associated circuits on a single chip made it possible to have microcomputers of fourth generation.
    
    Computer - Fifth Generation:-
    The period of fifth generation is 1980-till date. In the fifth generation, VLSI technology became ULSI (Ultra Large Scale Integration) technology, resulting in the production of microprocessor chips having ten million electronic components.

This generation is based on parallel processing hardware and AI (Artificial Intelligence) software. 
AI includes −

    Robotics
    Neural Networks
    Game Playing
    Development of expert systems to make decisions in real-life situations
    Natural language understanding and generation
